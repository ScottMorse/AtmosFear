This was a personal challenge to make a game using React and Redux in 3 days.  Project was started on December 3rd 2018, finalized on December 5th, and deployed for public play on December 6th.

What was created during this project time:
* Original game visuals (the space shuttle and enemy graphics)
* The game's entire functionality using the React and Redux JavaScript libraries
* Original background music and sound effects produced with Logic Pro

# Overview

In this game, you're a space shuttle trying to leave the atmosphere intact.  Avoid the obstacles with left/right keys, and advanced a level when you can make it to the end of the timer without losing all your health!

Music, pixel graphics, and functionality is all original by Scott Morse.
